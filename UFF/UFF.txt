showing that bonding capabilities of silylene, germylene, and
stannylene are considerably lower than those of methylene.
The electronic states 7BI,corresponding to species with a formal
u bond, lie above the 5BI states, and the SB,-7B, splitting diminishes regularly down the group. With the exception of MoCHz,
the septets 7B1are first-order stationary points with an imaginary
frequency associated with a wagging displacement of hydrogen
atoms out of the molecular plane. Full optimization of these
species leads to C, structures (states 7A’) considerably distorted
from planarity. This anomalous behavior of the transition metal-metal bond increases down the group and is related to nonclassical distortions observed in the series of compounds Si2H6,
Ge2H,, and Sn2H6. Because of such distortion, the ground state
of the heaviest element of the series, MoSnH,, is found to be bent
(es,
state 7A’) instead of planar (e2,,
state 5B,).
Finally, comparison of naked MoM’H,, with their pentacarbonylated homologous (CO)5Mo=M’H,, reveals that, as far
as Mo-M’ bond strengths and dissociation energies are concerned,

the Fischer-type of complexation is stronger than the Schrock one.

Note Added in Proof. After this paper was submitted for
publication, we found out the work reported by Cundari and

in which geometries and force constants of charged species

Abstract: A new molecular mechanics force field, the Universal force field (UFF), is described wherein the force field parameters
are estimated using general rules based only on the element, its hybridization, and its connectivity. The force field functional
forms, parameters, and generating formulas for the full periodic table are presented.

I. Introduction
Parameters and functional forms are the vital infrastructure
of molecular mechanics and dynamics force fields. One of the
most important uses of molecular dynamics and energy minimization is the estimation of structures for new molecules. Unfortunately, the popular force fields, based on the classic work
in the field,’”-‘ are limited to particular combinations of atoms,
for example, those of proteins, organics, or nucleic acids.laa-lf
Progress has been made toward development of force fields which
could, in principle, be extended to the entire periodic table though
systematic procedures for obtaining the parameters have not been
p r e ~ e n t e d . ~ Further,
,~
the angle bend function used in these
standard force fields (harmonic in e) has the wrong shape to
describe angular distortion approaching 180° for a nonlinear
molecule. This functional form cannot describe the dynamics of
inorganic materials such as zeolites which have equilibrium angles
of -150° and distort thermally to 180° with barriers to inversion
of 1 kcal/m01.~~In order to facilitate studies of a variety of
atomic associations, we have developed a new force field using
general rules for estimating force field parameters based on simple
relations. This set of fundamental parameters is based only on
the element, its hybridization, and connectivity. We refer to this
new force field as a Universal force field (UFF). The angular
distortion functional forms in UFF are chosen to be physically
reasonable for large amplitude displacements. The force field
functional forms and parameters are discussed in section 11.

11. Universal Force Field
The parameters used to generate the Universal force field
include a set of hybridization dependent atomic bond radii, a set
of hybridization angles, van der Waals parameters, torsional and
inversion barriers, and a set of effective nuclear charges.
A. Atom Types. The elements in the Universal force field
periodic table are the atom types: atoms of the same type may
only be similar chemically and physically, yet, as is the norm, they
are treated identically in the force field. As reported here, UFF
has 126 atom types. A five-character mnemonic label is used to
describe the atom types. The first two characters correspond to
the chemical symbol; an underscore appears in the second column
if the symbol has one letter (e.g., N- is nitrogen, Rh is rhodium).
The third column describes the hybridization or geometry: 1 =
linear, 2 = trigonal, R = resonant, 3 = tetrahedral, 4 = square
planar, 5 = trigonal bipyramidal, 6 = octahedral. Thus N-3 is
tetrahedral nitrogen, while Rh6 is octahedral rhodium. The forth
and fifth columns are used as indicators of alternate parameters
such as formal oxidation state: Rh6+3 indicates an octahedral
rhodium formally in the +3 oxidation state, e.g., Rh(NH3)63+.
H b indicates a bridging hydrogen as in B2Hs 0 - 3 2 is an oxygen
suited for framework oxygens of a zeolite lattice. P-3-q is a
tetrahedral four-coordinate phosphorus used to describe organometallic coordinated phosphines, e.g., (Ph3P)2PtC12.The current
UFF atom types are listed in Table I.
B. Form of the Force Field. The potential energy of an arbitrary geometry for a molecule is written as a superposition of
various two-body, three-body, and four-body interactions. The
potential energy is expressed as a sum of valence or bonded interactions and nonbonded interactions:

+ E, + E, +

E = ER + Eo

Ev;dw

+ E,,

The valence interactions consist of bond stretching (ER)discussed
in section 1I.C below and angular distortions discussed in section
1I.D. Included as angular distortions are bond angle bending (Eo),
dihedral angle torsion (E&, and inversion terms (E,). The
nonbonded interactions consist of van der Waals (Evdw)terms
discussed in section 1I.E and electrostatic (Ee,)terms discussed
in section 1I.F.
C. Bond Stretch. The universal force field describes the bond
stretch interaction as either a harmonic oscillator:
ER

= '/zklJ(r - rIJ)2

(la)

or as the Morse function:

where kIJis the force constant in units of (kcal/mol)/A2, rlJ is
the standard or natural bond length in angstroms, DIJis the bond
dissociation energy (kcal/mol), and

The Morse function is a more accurate description since it
implicitly includes anharmonic terms near equilibrium (rIJ)and
leads to a finite energy (DIJ)for breaking bonds. As with the
Dreiding force field2 for calculations using the Morse stretch, the
dissociation energy (DIJ)is set to n = 70 kcal/mol, where n is the
bond order between centers I and J. The remaining parameters
klJand rIJare discussed below, and the parameterization provided
below is for the harmonic form of the bond stretch.
1. Bond Radii. The natural bond length rIJis assumed to be
the sum of atom type specific single bond radii, plus a bond order
correction, plus an electronegativity correction:

+ rJ + rBO + rEy'

(2)

The single bond radii rI for H, C, N, and 0 were obtained by
fitting a small set of organic molecules. The hydro en radius was
fit to a methyl C-H distance in propane of 1.1 12
The carbon
radii C-3, CZ, and C-1 as well as the bond order proportionality
constant (discussed below) were fit to propane, propene, and
propyne C-C sin le, single, single, double, and triple bond distances of 1.526
1.501 A, 1.458 A, 1.336 A, and 1.207 A,
respectively. The radius for C R was fit to a benzene C-C distance
of 1.399 A (bond order 11/2). The nitrogen radii N-3, N R , N Z ,
and N-1 were fit to dimethylamine, N-methylformamide, dimethyldiazene, and acetonitrile C-N single, C-N single, N-N
double, and C-N triple bond distances of 1.462 A, 1.459 A, 1.247
A, and 1.157 A, respectively. The oxygen radii 0-3, 0-R, and
02 were fit to methyl ether, methyl vinyl ether, and acetone C 4
single, C-O single, and C-O double bond distances of 1.410 A,
1.428 A, and 1.222 A, respectively. The radius for 0-1 was fit
to a carbon monoxide C-O triple bond distance of 1.128 A. The
radius for 0 - 3 2 was fit to a Si-0 single bond distance of 1.592
8, in (C13Si)20. The radius of the bridging hydride H-b was fit
to a B-H bridging bond distance of 1.320 8, in diborane.
The radii of the group 1 elements were obtained from the
corresponding homonuclear gas-phase dimers.4b Ca, Sr, and Ba
radii were taken from the X-ray structures of cart~xylates,~
using
a fundamental 0 - 3 radius of 0.657 A. The Xe4+4 radius was
obtained from square-planar XeF4, using a fundamental F radius
of 0.668 A.6 The Kr4+4 radius was extrapolated from KrF2, based
on the 0.07-A decrease in Xe-F bond lengths observed in XeF:
relative to XeF,. The remaining noble gas radii were extrapolated.
P-3-q was taken from the P-C bond distances of two Pt trimethylphosphine complexes, and S Z from [CH3CSH4Mo~-S)S]
2.
S-R was obtained from thiophene and Ag from pentafluorophenyl(ylide)silver(I), all using a fundamental C-R bond radius
of 0.729 A.
Radii for actinides Th6+4 through Am6+4 were extrapolated
from the lanthanides, based on the 0.1-%Idifference between
Nd6+3 and U6+4 reference compound radii. Radii for actinides
Ac6+3 and Cm6+3 through Lw6+3 were extrapolated from the
lanthanides, based on the approximately 0.05-Adifference in ionic
radii between lanthanide+3 and actinide+3 halides.'
For the remaining elements, the single bond radii were obtained
directly from experimental structures of compounds containing
an element-carbon single bond using a fundamental C-3 bond
radius of 0.757 A, or were interpolated. Gas-phase experimental
structures were normally taken from published compilation^;^,^
X-ray structures were obtained by searching the Cambridge data
base.1° A listing of the raw bond distances, the compounds they
were taken from, and the literature sources are collected in the
supplementary material.
The initial observation and subsequent understanding of many
important structural effects in chemistry arose by comparing
=standard'' bond distances (from a summation of covalent radii)
with experimental bond distances. These structural-electronic
effects include electronegativity, resonance, metal-ligand
bonding, metal-ligand ?r back-bonding, and the trans influence.
A force field capable of fully predicting molecular structure must
reproduce these effects. In order to account for these effects and

where the proportionality constant X = 0.1332 was determined
for the set propane, propene, and propyne simultaneously with
the (2-3, C-2, and C-1 radii. The single bond covalent distance
is included in the correction to provide the correct metric
throughout the periodic table. The amide C-N bond order of 1.41
was used in order to reproduce the amide C-N bond distance of
1.366 A in N-methylformamide, the C-R and N-R single bond
radii having been determined above. A fractional amide bond

order is reasonable given the polar nature of the C-O T bond and
the resulting parital delocalization of the nitrogen A lone pair onto
carbon. Intra-ring bonds of aromatic rings are assigned bond
orders based on the number of A electrons, resulting in a bond
order of 1.5 for normal aromatic rings.

is used directly with the previously reported GMP electronegativity
setal3 For example, for a Si*-3-2
bond the electronegativity
correction is 0.0533 A.
2. Force Constants. The bond stretching force constants are
atom based and are obtained from a previously reported generalization of Badger's rules.14 Consider the following simple
description of the bounding curve
ER = Eo - FR - G(ZI*Zj*/R)
(5)
where F is to be determined, ZI* and ZJ* are effective charges,
and G = 332.06 so that R is in A, Z is in electron units, and E R
is in kcal/mol. The assumption is that the bonding is dominated
by attractive ionic terms (even for H2) plus short-range Pauli
repulsions (approximated as linear). The condition for an
equilibrium structure leads to
0 = (aE,/aR)o = F - G(ZI*Zj*/Rz)

or
F = G(ZI*Zj*/fIj2)
The force constant then becomes

The ZI* (effective atomic charges, in electron units) are leastsquares tit to a set of diatomic data representing 56 elements from
Huber and Herzberg."b The ZI* for H is set at the value for H2,
and H-C is assigned a weight of 10 in the least-squares optimization. The remaining ZI* (effective atomic charges) are
interpolated or extrapolated. The bond radii and effective charges
are listed in Table I. For reference, the UFF C-N amide force
constant of 1293 kcal/mol.A2 can be compared to the corresponding AMBERldd force constant of 980 kcal/mol-A2 and
CHARMMIbbforce constant of 674 kcal/mol.A2.
D. Angular Distortions. General Fourier expansions (see eq
7) are employed in the Universal force field to describe all angular
distortions because the expansions can be constructed (1) to have
derivatives that are singularity free, (2) to have the appropriate
distortions for the large amplitude motions found in molecular
dynamics simulations, and (3) so that the C,,coefficients can be
straightfonvardly c h a m to satisfy appropriate, physically justified,
boundary conditions.

1. Angle Bend. In UFF, the angle bend term is described with
a small cosine Fourier expansion in 8:

where the coefficients C, are chosen to satisfy appropriate
boundary conditions including that the function have a minimum
at the natural bond angle 0,. The simple m i n e Fourier expansion
was chosen over the more common harmonic in 8 expansion'
because of the better description of large amplitude motions" as
found in molecular dynamics simulations. The Fourier expansion
was chosen over the mathematically equivalent (for the general
nonperiodic case) harmonic in cosine 6 expansion15 owing to the
straightforward and consistent extension of a Fourier expansion
to symmetric/periodic coordination environments found in metallic
complexes such as square planar or octahedral. Additionally, as
discussed below, the Fourier expansion representation has a sound
physical basis.
The simple cosine Fourier expansion was selected over the
SHAPESI6 Fourier expansion form
E~ = KIjK [ I

E C,, cos ne
n-0

(94

where
and
Q =

- pe,

(9c)

due to the more smoothly defined description for large 0, for the
simple cosine Fourier expansion. As is apparent from eq 9b, as
Bo approaches A, p , the periodicity, will increase rapidly (owing
to the increasingly smaller denominator). Consider, for example,
S i U S i linkages in zeolite structures where eo is approximately
145'. If 0, indeed equals 145', the function is smaller by a factor
of 10 at 0' than it is at 180°, whereas if eo = 135' or 150°, the
function is equal valued a t 0' and 180'. When Bo = 144', the
potential is zero a t 8, = 0'. This wild oscillation is caused by p
passing through the integer value, 5, at 144'.
For linear, trigonal-planar, square-planar, and octahedral coordination environments, two-term Fourier expansions are used
each with a n = 0 term Coand a n = 1, 3,4, or 4 term, respectively.
Thus eq 8 simplifies to:
KIJK
EO = - [ l - COS (ne)]
n2

These terms are precisely the same terms as are used in the
SHAPES force field for these symmetric/periodic coordination
environments.
For the general nonlinear case, for example, for water, the bend
function should have a minimum with Eo = 0 at 8 = Bo = 104So,
the second derivative at Bo equal to the force constant, and a
maximum at 180'. For the proper choice of angular terms,
consider the set of group 6 hydrides H20, H2S,H2Se, H2Te, and
H2Po. In general, group 6 elements (0,S,Se, Te, and Po) use
orthogonal unpaired p orbitals to form covalent bonds, this suggests
equilibrium bond angles for the hydrides of 90' and that a cos
28 angle term will describe angular distortion. For H20, however,
the hydrogens are sufficiently close to each other that Pauli repulsions cause the bond angle to open up to 104.5'. This steric
repulsion, with constant bond distance, is a maximum at 0' and
a minimum at 180°, suggesting the addition of a cos 0 angle term
to the cos 28 discussed above. This leads to a three-term Fourier
expansion (for the general nonlinear case)

gives a measure of intrinsic 1,3 steric repulsion.
a. Standard Bond Angles. The natural angles for the group
15, 17, and 18 main group elements are obtained from standard
reference structures of the parent hydrides. Thus 0 - 3 has Bo =
104.5' from HzO,
while S3 has Bo = 92.2' from HzS. Exceptions
O R , and N-2. The bond angles for 0-32,O-R,
include 0-32,
and N-2 are fit to (C13Si)z0,methyl vinyl ether, and dimethyldiazene angles of 146O, 118.3', and 112.3', respectively. Where
structural data are unavailable, the natural angles are extrapolated
from the element above it in the periodic table. The remaining
elements are all assumed to have regular octahedral, tetrahedral,
trigonal, or linear structures. The natural angles are collected
in Table I.
b. Force Constants. The angle bend force constants are generated using a previously reported angular generalization of
Badger's r ~ 1 e s . lBasically,
~
the functional form (6) is assumed
to extend to the I and K atoms of a angle bend for polyatomics,
and the effective charges listed in Table I are used. Thus starting
with
Eo = Eo - FB - @(z1*zK*/rIK)
where F is to be determined and

Table 111. sp3 Torsional Barrier Parameters

where the distances rlJand rJK are as defined in (2) above and
0 is an undetermined parameter. From an examination of the
bending vibrational frequences of AX4,A = C, S,Ge, and Sn and
X = H, F, C1, Br, and I, it was determined that
8 = 664.12/r1jrj~
leads to the best compromise functional form. For reference, the
UFF C-N-C amide force constant of 105.5 kcal/mol.rad2 can
be compared to the corresponding AMBERIdd force constant of
100 kcal/mol.radz and CHARMMIbb force constant of 70
kcal/mol.radz.
2. Torsion. The torsional terms for two bonds IJ and KL
connected via a common bond JK is described with a small cosine
Fourier expansion in 6:
m

E,

KIJKLE Cn COS ~ + I J K L
n-0

(14)

where KljKL and the coefficients C,, are determined by the rotational barrier V,, the periodicity of the potential, and the equilibrium angle. For a given central J-K bond, all torsions about
this bond are considered, with each torsional barrier being divided
by the number of torsions present about this J-K bond. The
present torsional periodicities and minima are the same as those
described in the recently published DREIDING force fieldZwith
modifications to the torsional barriers V, to account for periodic
trends. Using the present Fourier representation (eq 14) for the
torsional potential, Co= 1, C,, = --cos n&, and Km = l/zV, which
yields

Specific general cases include (a)j = an sp3 center and k = an
sp3 center where n = 3 and +o = 180' (or 60°), (b) j = an spz
center and k = an sp3 center where n = 6 and +o = 0' (V, = 1
kcal/mol), and (c) j = an spz center and k = an spz center of
variable bond order where n = 2 and +o = 180' (or 60').
The torsional barriers involving a pair of sp3centers (V, 3) are

Torsional barriers involving a pair of sp2 centers ( Vsp2) with

The constants 5 and 4.18 were obtained from fitting the low energy
a,, bl,, and bzg vibrational modes of ethylene,IE the gas-phase
barrier of N,N-dimethylformamide ( A P = 19.7 kcal/mol),lg and
the low-energy ezu,a,,, and b2gvibrational modes of benzene.ls
The vj constants are assigned values of 2, 1.25,0.7,0.2,and 0.1
for the first through sixth periods (based roughly on the group
4 V, values discussed above), respectively.
As in the DREIDING force field,z the torsional terms for sp3
group 6 central atoms are treated as exceptions based on valence
considerations which suggest that the bonds have a dihedral angle
of 90'. For a single bond involving a pair of group 6 sp3 atoms,
eq 16 is used with VJ = 2 kcal/mol for oxygen and VJ = 6.8
kcal/mol for the remaining group 6 elements (fit for HZOzand
HzSzZO).For this case the periodicity (n)is 2 and the equilibrium
angle +o is 90'. For a single bond involving a sp3 atom of the
oxygen column and an sp2 or resonant atom of another column,
eq 17 is used directly. For this case the periodicity (n) is 2 and
the equilibrium angle dois 90'. The torsional potentials for central
bonds involving non-main-group elements were assigned a value
of zero. Torsional potentials for central bonds involving sp-hy( 1 7) The inadequacy of a harmonic in B representation has been reported
previously; see, for example, Figure 1 of ref 16 and Figure 3 of ref 4a. An
additional discussion of problems with angular potentials is provided in:

bridized centers X-1 were assigned a value of zero. In addition,
when angles about the central atoms approach 180°, the potential
energy and derivative terms are set to zero as is conventionally
done.
The remaining exception is for the case of a single bond involving one sp2 atom and one sp3 atom where the sp2 atom is
bonded to another sp2 atom (e.g., propene). For this case we use
Vo = 2.0 kcal/mol, n = 3, and do = 180O.
The overall reproduction of torsional barriers is quite good (see
Table 11). The C-3-sp3 barriers were chosen to fit the experimental
barriers, the H202and H2S2values were best compromise values,
and anisole, thioanisole, acetaldehyde, isoprene, and ethylbenzene
are tests of eq 17.
3. Inversion. For UFF, a one- or two-term cosine Fourier
expansion in w is used for atoms I bonded exactly to three other
atoms J, K, L:

E , = K I J K L (+
~ OCI COS WIJKL + C2 COS ~ W I J K L )(18)
where K I j K L is the force constant in (kcal/mol) and w1jKL is the
angle between the IL axis and the IJK plane. For a given central
atom I there are three unique axes (IL, IJ, and IK); all three are
considered, with each inversion barrier being divided by the
number of inversions present (three) about center I. The cos 2w
term yields a minimum for w = 90° and a maximum for w = O0
as would be appropriate for PH3. The cos w term yields a minimum for w = Oo and a maximum for w = 180° as would be
appropriate for ethylene. Linear combinations of these terms will
describe all intermediate cases. The inversion potential can also
be expressed in terms of the computationally convenient normal
to the IJK plane and the angle that the IL axis makes with respect
to the normal to the IJK plane, 7 I j K L . The two forms are related
by w = y - T .

For C-2 and C R sp2 atom types with exactly three substituents,
C, = 1, Cl = -1, and C2 = 0. If carbon is bonded to 0-2, the
force constant is set to 50 kcal/mol, as fit to the bz wag of
formaldehyde; otherwise, the force constant is set to 6 kcal/mol,
as fit to the low-energy a,, blur and b2 vibrational modes of
ethylene and the low-energy e2,, a2,, and bzavibrational modes
of benzene.l* Force constants for groups 5 and 6 were chosen to
fit the experimentally observed inversion barriers for the group
5 hydrides NH3 and PH3.21 The wo were obtained from standard
reference structures of the hydrides and the C,, coefficients fit to
a minimum with E, = 0 at w = wo and that E , for the maximum
at w = Oo be equal to Ebarricr.
In order to fit observed barriers,

inversion terms corresponding to Ebarrier

constants for all other atom types are set to zero.
E. van der Waals. Nonbonded interactions (van der Waals
forces) are included in the Universal force field. A Lennard-Jones
6-1 2 type expression is used:

facilitates summation of van der Waals terms for crystalline
systems. The molecular parameters (distances, angles, inversion
barriers, and torsional barriers) are developed here using geometric
distance combination rules. UFF assumes standard geometric
combination rules for the well depth:
DIj = (DIDJ)1/2
(22)
where DI is the atomic van der Waals energy. Values of the van
der Waals distances xI and DI for UFF are listed in Table I.
The most difficult part of developing a general force field is
the assignment of van der Waals parameters. The present Lennard-Jones van der Waals parameters are developed within the
conceptual framework of the exponentiald form. This functional
form is physically based on the short-range exponential repulsion
arising from Pauli orthogonalization and the long-range 1/#
induced dipole-induced dipole dispersive attraction:
EvdW =

Ae-BX- c 6 / X 6

(23)

The repulsive exponential B and the dispersive attractive term
C, are developed below for the entire periodic table. The third
degree of freedom contained in eq 23 is determined from an
empirical relation obtained between literature values of Lennard-Jones distances and the present repulsive exponentials B.
The repulsion exponent B can be developed from a consideration
of the physical basis of the repulsive term, that is, the repulsive
interaction between pairs of closed shells. This repulsive interaction
to first order is proportional to the overlap between the wave
functions squared. We begin with the approximate relationZ2that
the long-range distance dependence of a wave function is

-

e-(fir
(24)
The overlap between a pair of exponential functions (with the same
Slater exponent 5 ) is
\k

S = (1 + 5r + y3(5r)2)e-€r

(25)

Thus the repulsive interaction (S2)between a pair of atoms
s
2
e-2€r
(26)

-

is directly related to the electron density where, from eq 24

5 = d21P
(27)
This leads to the exponent in the exponential-6 being defined as
B = 25 = 2 d 2 I P

where DIJ is the well depth in kcal/mol and xIJis the van der
Waals bond length in A. The 6-12 Lennard-Jones form is chosen
over an exponential-6 form (discussed below) for its numerical
stability; the exponential-6 form blows up for small internuclear
separations. A complete set of exponential-6 parameters are
provided in Table I although the valence parameterization discussed above actually used Lennard-Jones 6-12 nonbond potentials.
As is conventionally done, the general xIJand DIj are obtained
from the homonuclear parameters through the use of combination
rules. The choice of combination rules for the Lennard-Jones
distances is somewhat problematic. The use of an arithmetic mean
for the Lennard-Jones distance,

As discussed previously? there are three simple choices for this
third parameter
(1) assign a value of 12 to (, which results
in the Lennard-Jones and exponential-6 forms having precisely
the same long-range distance dependence; (2) assign a value of
13.772 to (, which gives the exponential-6 and 6-12 forms the
same curvature at the bottom of the well; or (3) fit (to a discrete
set of crystal structures for each element. Figure 2 shows the
Lennard-Jones curves for three values of (with B and c6 fixed.
Given the extreme sensitivity of the resulting Lennard-Jones
parameters to the choice of (, the enormity of the challenge of
fitting parameters for the entire periodic table, and the difficulty
in factoring out special intermolecular bonding interactions in the
crystal structures of the element^,^^*^^ we have chosen to use the
available data and empirically estimate { as discussed below.

for exponential-6 or 6-12 xI(s, linear relations are observed for

and row in the periodic table (see Figure 3). The scatter in the
plot for the second period can be attributed largely to the choice
of partial charges for the molecules used in the determination of
the xIparameters from X-ray crystal structures. Given the uncertainty in partial charge assignment, we have chosen to use two
neutral cases ( = 12.73 for C, from graphiteI5 and ( = 15.44 for

The discontinuity in slope between the third and fourth periods
in Figure 3 can be attributed to the onset of special intermolecular
bonding interactions in the ~ o l i d s ; ~P~ and
, ~ ' S are both nonmetals
but As and Se are both metallic or near metallic. These special
bonding interactions should not be included in a van der Waals
parameter set. Thus, for the remaining main group elements, eq
38 is used wherein a slope of 1 is assumed (extrapolated from the
slopes of eq 36 and 37 and the noble gases are assigned a value

The repulsive expmentials Band dispersion terms c

the shape parameters t are used to define the Lennard-Jones
distances xIand well depths using eq 33 and 34.
The thus obtained Lennard-Jones parameters provide reasonable
estimates for the elements in their atomic state. A comparison
of the UFF Lennard-Jones parameters with literature values for
several elements is provided in Table IV.
For metals in positive oxidation states, the above estimates are
not appropriate. For cationic metals we have obtained ionic c61+
and BIt as follows. The exponent BIt is defined as

where IP21is the second ionization energy for atom I as obtained

energies of atom I, and aIand
for the metallic neutral and positive ions. Setting (to 12 for the
metallic ions the Lennard-Jones distance, xIt can be directly
obtained from eq 33 and DI+from eq 34.
These Lennard-Jones parameters provide reasonable values for
elements in a cationic state. For example, the UFF distance and
well depth of x1 = 3.148 A and DI = 0.036 kcal/mol for Ag can
be compared with a distance parameter of xI = 3.100 A obtained
by fitting the crystal structure for AgCl with a QEq partial charge
on Ag of 0.62 and a DI assigned a value of 0.036 kcal/mol. The
experimental cell parameter for AgCl is 5.556 A;29
if the UFF
Ag' parameters are used, a cell constant of 5.592 A is obtained.
For metals with one electron in the valence shell, the above
procedure breaks down; the discontinuity in the IP versus charge
curve associated with removing an electron from the core, rather
than an additional valence electron, is likely responsible. For the
group 1 elements we have chosen to fit the distance parameters
to experimental lattice parameters with assumed well depths. The
results of the fits are provided in Table V.
The derived van der Waals parameters can be compared to van
der Waals parameters in the literature explicitly fit to crystal
properties. The present hydrogen radius and well depth of 2.886

III. Calculational Results and Summary
Detailed comparisons of conformational energetics and molecular structures with experimental and published MM2(3) results
for organic compounds3' and application of UFF to predict
structures of main
transition metal inorganic, and organometallic compounds33are the subjects of future papers. Here
we present the results on a select set of molecules to demonstrate
the overall utility of the approach. We begin with structural
comparison for a few organic molecules where the bond order
varies to demonstrate the utility of a radius plus bond order
correction distance function, eq 2. This is followed by three main
group inorganic molecules: octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane,

1,3,5,7-tetrakis(trifuoromethyl)-2,4,6,8,9,lO-hexathia-l,3,5,7tetragermaadamantane, and dodecaphenylcyclohexastannane.We
conclude with calculations on a set of transition metal complexes
including tris(hexamethyldisilylamide)scandium(III), (L- or Dalanine-N-acetato)(L-histidinato)chromium(III), bis(N-allylsalicylidineiminato)nickel(II), and 1,2-bis(dimethylphosphino)ethane(neopentylidyne) (neopentylidene)(neopentyl)tungsten (VI).
A procedure. Minimizations were camed out on a IRIS 4D20
using a Newton-Raphson minimization scheme with a norm of
the gradient convergence criteria of 1 X
(kcal/mol)/A and
were verified as minima by the absence of negative eigenvalues
in the force constant matrix. Saddle points for torsional barriers
were obtained using a hill climbing algorithm and were verified
by the presence of a single negative eigenvalue in the force constant
matrix.
B. Organics. The C-3, (2-2, and C-1 radii as well as X of eq
3 were chosen to reproduce the various C-C distances of propane,
propene, and propyne. From the results presented in Figure 4
(experimental quantities in parentheses), it is apparent that it is
possible to reproduce the five unique distances in the set with four
adjustable parameters (three radii plus bond order scaling parameter A). Further, the experimental C-H distances in propene
and propyne are also reproduced. The angles are less well reproduced: the C-C-C angles of propane and propene are underestimated by 1.1" and 2.3'. Further, the central C-C bond
of butadiene is long by 0.006 A, and the C-C double bonds of

butadiene are calculated to be 0.015 A short. This pattern for
butadiene indicates that partial (but not substantial) A bonding
between the central carbons is not being accounted for in the force
field.
For nitrogen-containing organic molecules, the experimental
structures are reasonably well described except for cases with
partial A bonding which is not included in this version of UFF.
For dimethylamine (see Figure 5 ) , the N-H distance is 0.025 A
too long and the C-N-C angle 1.go too small, though the angle
has opened up significantly (1 10.2O) from the equilibrium angle
of N-3 (106.7'). For trimethylamine the C-N-C angle is only
0.9' too small, though the C-N distances are 0.02 8, large. The
C-N distance is underestimated by 0.04 A in dimethyldiazene,
but the remaining geometric parameters are well reproduced. For
acetonitrile, the C-C single bond distance is 0.005 A long. For
2-cyano- 1-ethylene the calculated C-C single bond is overestimated by 0.034 A, indicating partial A bonding between the
centers. For 2-cyano-1-ethylene the C-C double bond is 0.005

A short, the C-N triple bond is 0.007 A short, and the C-C single
bond is 0.015 A long also indicative of partial ?r bonding not
accounted for in the force field.
Reasonable agreement with experiment is also found for oxygen-containing organic molecules (see Figure 6). The C-0-C
angle of dimethyl ether is 2.5' smaller than experiment, though
it does open up (109.2') significantly from the equilibrium angle
of 104.51'. For methyl ethyl ether the calculated C-C distance
is 0.001 A long; the 0-methyl and 0-ethyl distances are 0.005
8, too short and 0.007 8, too long, respectively. The C - 0 4 angle
is 2.5' too small. For methyl vinyl ether the computed C-C double
bond is 0.002 A long, the C-O single bond is fit exactly, but the
vinyl (2-0 distance is 0.053 8, long, indicative of partial ?r bonding
being ignored. The C-O double bond of acetaldehyde is overestimated by 0.004 A, and the C-C bond is underestimated by
0.01 A. For acetone the C-C single bonds are 0.009 A short and
the C-C-C an le is 2.9' large. For propynal the C-O double
bond is 0.006 long, the C-C single bond is well reproduced,
and the C-C triple bond is 0.004 A short. The calculated C-O
double bond of acrolein is 0.001 A long, the C-C single bond is
0.002 8, long, and the C-C double bond is 0.01 A short. For
methyl formate the C-0 double bond is 0.019 A long, the ester
C-O single bond is 0.067 A long (indicative of missing A delocalization), and the other C - O single bond distance is 0.012 A
short.
For amides the calculated structures are acceptable (see Figure
7). The calculated C-O double bond of acetamide is 0.002 A
too long, the C-C single bond is 0.021 A too short, and the C-N
resonating bond is 0.01 5 8, too short. For N-methylformamide
the calculated C-O double bond is 0.001 A short, the C-N resonating bond is 0.001 A short, and the C-N single bond is fit.
The C-N-C angle is 0.7' larger than experiment.
For organic molecules with bonds without partial ?r bonding,
the force field reproduces the experimental organic structures to
within 0.02 A and 2'.

bonds, experimental structures are reasonably well described in

in Figure 8 and the individual molecules discussed below.
OcCametbykyclotetxaneM X-ray studies have shown that
this eight-membered siloxane ring is puckered, with Si-0-Si angles
of 142'. As discussed in the main group benchmark paper,32the
correct description of Si-0-Si linkages by molecular mechanics
is still a matter of concern; the Si-0 bond distances and Si-0-Si
angles are very sensitive to the nature of the other substituents
bound to Si. Agreement between UFF and experiment is fair for
this molecule. The calculated Si-0 distances are 0.058 8, short
and the Si-0-Si bond angle is 3.1' large. The calculated Si-C
distances are 0.054 8, short and the C-Si-C angles are 3.6' large.
The 0-Si-0 bond angle is only 0.5' too large.

of this G e S analogue of adamantane is well reproduced by UFF.
The calculated Ge-S bond distances are only 0.011 A long. The
Ge-C distances are 0.05 8, short and the F-C distances are 0.07

the Ge-S-Ge angles are 2.4O small.
Dodecaphenylcyclohexstamane.36 In contrast to the difficulties encountered in correctly predicting Si-Si bond lengths as
reported in the organic benchmark paper,31 the structure of this
Sn ring is well reproduced by UFF. The calculated Sn-Sn bond
distances are underestimated by only 0.001 A, and the Sn-C
distances are underestimated by 0.036 8,. The calculated SnSn-Sn angles are 1.8' small and the C-Sn-C angles are 3.6' large.
The Sn-Sn-Sn-Sn dihedral angle is 5.3' large.

(L- or ~-Ala~ne-N-acetato)(~-histidinato)chromium(III).~~
X-ray analysis of this classical coordination complex shows the
environment around Cr is a distorted octahedral. UFF can only
partially reproduce the distortion, with bond angle errors of up
to 8'. The H-bonding network observed in the experimental
structure likely contributes to the distortion from octahedral
symmetry. This H-bonding effect is not included in the force field.
Fair agreement between UFF and experiment is observed for the
Cr-ligand distances: the calculated Cr-O bond distances, on
average, are 0.047 8, short; the histidine Cr-N distance is 0.1 17
8, long using a bond order (the distance would be 0.047 8, short
using a bond order of 1); and the calculated amino Cr-N distances
are 0.078 8, and 0.058 8, long.

coordination environment calculated by UFF is in good agreement
with the experimental X-ray structure. The calculated Ru-C1
distances are 0.006 8, short, on average. The calculated Cl-Ru-Cl
angle is 0.9' too small, and the N-Ru-N angles are 4.1 O and 5.1 '
too large. The Ru-N distances range from being 0.034 8, too
short to being 0.015 8, too long (using a bond order of 3/2). Since
ruthenium is a low-spin d6 ion in this complex, a bond order of
3 / 2 is appropriate due to back-bonding involving the C-N T *
orbitals."

away from tungsten is not accounted for in the present force field
because an octahedral atom type is used for tungsten (W-6+6).

too small by 8", the C1-W-C5 is too small by 20°. The experimental M-C single, double, and triple bond distances are well
reproduced for this unique complex. This is a remarkable result
considering a single covalent W radius is used in the U F F force
field; the bond order correction can correctly account for the
change in bond distance as a function of bond order. The W-C
single bond is 0.05 A short, the W-C double bond is 0.027 A long,
and the W - C triple bond is 0.029 A long. The electronic effect
at metal alkylidene centers whereby the M-C-C angle is enlarged
as a result of a electronic donation from the a C-H bond to the
metal center is not accounted for in the UFF force field, and hence
the W-C6-C7 bond angle is 17" too small. The W-C-C angles

IV. Conclusions
It is possible to construct a force field from simple rules and
atomic parameters that is capable of reproducing most structural
features across the periodic table with errors less than 0.1 A in
bond distances and 5" to 10" in angle bend. Further applications
of UFF to organic, main group, and metal compounds are described in the following papers. Enhancements to UFF to decrease
structural and energetic errors are underway.

Abstract: The application of a Universal force field (UFF) to the treatment of organic molecules is described. The ability
of the force field to predict the structures of a variety of organic molecules is examined, and the results are compared with
the MM2 or MM3 force fields. UFF correctly predicts the structures of unstrained and uncongested hydrocarbons, silanes,
alkenes, saturated amines, saturated ethers and phosphines, aromatic systems, and simple unconjugated multiple bond containing
compounds such as nitriles, ketones, and imines well. Bond angles are usually correct to within 3O, and bond lengths usually
to within 0.02A. Specifically, the rms error in the UFF predicted C-C bond distances is 0.021 A, with a maximum of 0.067
A for a set of 65 distances. For comparison, the MM2/3 RMS error in C-C distances is 0.012 A with a maximum of 0.029
for the same set of molecules. The UFF rms error in C-N bond distances is 0.024A, with a maximum of 0.041 A for a set
of 13 distances. For the same set of molecules, the MM2/3 rms error in C-N distances is 0.013 A with a maximum of 0.031.
The UFF rms error in C-O bond distances is 0.025 A, with a maximum of 0.05 A for a set of seven distances. For the same
set of molecules the MM2/3 rms error in C-0 distances is 0.007 A with a maximum of 0.015. The ability of UFF to calculate
conformational energy differences in simple organic molecules is also examined.
